3. Find this line: $SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:3001/api/pc/update"

5. Save the file

STEP 2: RUN THE SCRIPT
1. Right-click on the PowerShell file (.ps1)
2. Select "Run with PowerShell"
3. OR open PowerShell and navigate to Desktop:
   - Press Windows + R, type "powershell", press Enter
   - Type: cd Desktop
   - Type: .\YOUR_SCRIPT_NAME.ps1
4. You should see: "Data sent successfully for pc-xxx-x"

STEP 3: KEEP IT RUNNING
- Keep the PowerShell window open
- The script will send data every 30 seconds
