Open Command Prompt (cmd) and type:
pip install requests psutil

STEP 3: SETUP YOUR PC SCRIPT
1. Copy the Python file I sent you to your Desktop
2. Right-click the file and select "Edit" or open with Notepad
3. Find this line: SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:3001/api/pc/update"
4. Change "localhost" to the IP address I give you (e.g., "192.168.1.100")
5. Save the file

STEP 4: RUN THE SCRIPT
1. Open Command Prompt (cmd)
2. Navigate to Desktop: cd Desktop
3. Run: python YOUR_SCRIPT_NAME.py
4. You should see: "Data sent successfully for pc-xxx-x"

STEP 5: KEEP IT RUNNING
- Keep the Command Prompt window open
- The script will send data every 30 seconds
- Press Ctrl+C to stop when done

TROUBLESHOOTING:
